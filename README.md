# LearningTechArt

This README will document my learning process with all things technical art: shaders, rendering pipelines, etc.

**Using:** Unity 2020

## First Steps: Shaders
Results of following Catlike Coding's rendering tutorial series - https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/

### 2 - Textured With Detail
- Learned how to create detailed, high resolution textures while only using 512x512px sized textures
- Created a marble texture that uses 1 512x512px marble texture and 512x512px marble detail texture to simulate details on the marble up close

### 1 - First Shader
- Familiarized myself with how to write shader code in ShaderLab
- Learned about shaders core concepts like shaders, fragment program, vertex program, textures, tiling, offsets
